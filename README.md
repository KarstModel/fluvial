Learning Objectives:

A. Software engineering objectives

Through implementing this coupled notebook, students will be able to design a jupyter notebook to:

1. Introduce two model grid types (network and rectilinear)
2. Connecting these two grids by layering them on top of each other.
3. Connecting two rectilinear grids by having output of one feed into the input for another.

B. Fluvial geomorphology objectives

Given a structured Jupyter notebook with parameters that can vary, students will have the opportunity to explore the synergistic effects of:

- rainfall intensity
- rainfall distribution
- sediment supply
- infiltration properties on overbank flow in a floodplain
